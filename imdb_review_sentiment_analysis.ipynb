It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.  I laughed, lots. I cried, lots. I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots I even punched the air in a \"go on!\" during one scene  I can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.  Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.  Go with it. Enjoy the ride.  Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.  I have nothing else to say.  10/10. Well done Russo brothers.
